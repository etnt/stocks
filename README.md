## Create a balanced stock portfolio using Google Sheet and AppScript

Have a look at this [video](https://youtu.be/DV2nnXCDXNk?si=8qfXGwztY7jiBaQz)

The AppScript used can be found [here](AppScript/balanced_portfolio.gs)

## Record a portfolio value once a day

Here we will record a portfolio value by appendng the value to a table,
located in another Sheet, once a day, together with the date.

We setup a trigger to run the AppScript once a day.

This will make it possible to produce nice graphs/diagrams of the portfolio progress.
