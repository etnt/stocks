// Inside Bars Indicator
// 
// Description:
// This indicator identifies and highlights price action patterns where a bar's high and low
// are completely contained within the previous bar's range. Inside bars are significant
// technical patterns that often signal a period of price consolidation or uncertainty,
// potentially leading to a breakout in either direction.
//
// Trading Literature & Theory:
// Inside bars are well-documented in technical analysis literature:
// - Steve Nison discusses them in "Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques" as a form
//   of harami pattern, indicating potential trend reversals
// - Thomas Bulkowski's "Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns" categorizes inside bars as
//   a consolidation pattern with statistical significance for breakout trading
// - Alexander Elder references them in "Trading for a Living" as indicators of
//   decreasing volatility and potential energy build-up
// - John Murphy's "Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets" includes inside bars
//   as part of price action analysis for market psychology understanding
//
// The pattern is particularly significant because it represents:
// 1. Volatility Contraction: A narrowing of price range indicating potential energy build-up
// 2. Institutional Activity: Often shows large players absorbing or distributing positions
// 3. Decision Point: Market participants evaluating the previous bar's significance
//
// Trading Applications:
// 1. Breakout Trading
//    - Watch for breaks above the parent bar's high (bullish signal)
//    - Monitor breaks below the parent bar's low (bearish signal)
//    - Multiple consecutive inside bars can indicate stronger breakout potential
//
// 2. Market Psychology
//    - Inside bars represent a period of equilibrium between buyers and sellers
//    - Shows market uncertainty and potential energy building up
//    - Often precedes significant price movements
//
// Best Market Conditions:
// - Trending markets approaching potential reversal points
// - After strong momentum moves where the market needs to digest gains
// - Near key support/resistance levels
// - During pre-breakout consolidation phases
//
// Complementary Indicators:
// - Volume indicators to confirm breakout strength
// - Trend indicators (Moving Averages, ADX) for context
// - Momentum indicators (RSI, MACD) for additional confirmation
//
// Risk Management:
// - Use parent bar's range for stop loss placement
// - Wait for breakout confirmation before entry
// - Consider time-based exits if breakout doesn't occur
// - More reliable on higher timeframes
//
// Note: The indicator works best when combined with proper risk management
// and overall market context analysis. Avoid trading every inside bar pattern
// and always confirm with volume and other technical indicators.
